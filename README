./run_models.sh runs all models and outputs to txt/model_*.txt

NOTE that the formatting in txt/ is special (i.e. it doesn't get printed out that way), 
and you COULD be overwriting things by running the script. 

(Don't worry. This is on github.)


If you want to run the models yourself, you can run them individually with:
python model_<whatever>.py


You can also create basic visualizations of the raw data with
python vis_basic.py



To run tSNE and PCA and get some fancy 3D animated images, run 
python vis_transform.py


###########################

You can find existing images in png/

png/analysis: graphs current error of models vs naive
png/basic-vis: outputs from vis_basic
png/vis: outputs from vis_transform (including 3d animated spinny graph of the data post-tSNE)
png/models: includes ALLL the images from running the HMM baum-welch algorithm (there are a lot)

The name format is as such:
<location> - <model name> - <data plotted> <num hidden states> . png
Note that the x axis is always time, the y axis is always the <data plotted>, and the color
always refers to the hidden states.

How to read the output in txt/

step1: pay attention if there's any direct warning messages


Here's how to read a sample format of the output:

in txt/model_basic.txt:
