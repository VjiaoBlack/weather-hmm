- Visualizing Data
	- Raw
	- PCA w/ and w/o wind
	- Isomap and tSNE w/ and w/o wind

- Trying to Figure Out Data
	- KMeans 
		- on raw
		- on tSNE output???
	- GHMM
	- Autoencoder
	- Appending data to itself to create higher dimensional data
		- implicit ngrams within each data value 
		- then, run GHMM or autoencoder.

- Test Methods with NGrams
	- GHMM
	- Autoencoder
	- Compare to Recurrent NN
